# Emotion_Detection_System

The Emotion Detector is a desktop application that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect human emotions from images. The application is built with Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and uses a model trained on the FER (Facial Expression Recognition) dataset to predict emotions. Users can upload an image, and the application will predict and display the emotion depicted in the image.
